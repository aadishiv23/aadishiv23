# **Aadi Shiv Malhotra**

An undergraduate student at the **University of Michigan**, studying **Computer Science** and **Cognitive Science**. I primarily work with **Swift** and its associated frameworks, including **SwiftUI** and **UIKit**. 

I have experience as a **Research Assistant** at the **Ljungman Lab**, where I contributed to our **KLIPP team**, developing CRISPR-based precision cancer therapies. During my first two and a half years in the wet lab, I focused on **cell cultures**, conducting experiments on various cell lines, and investigating **circularRNA** for more efficient RNA delivery.

More recently, I worked on our **technology pipelines**, helping identify **ecDNAs** that could be targeted in cancerous cells.

Previously, I interned at **Fetch** during the **summer of 2024** as an **iOS Engineering Intern**. During my time there, I contributed to delivering features for **search functionality**, enhancing the **new home page**, and integrating **Shortcuts and App Intents**.
